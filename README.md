<!-- Stacked Cards Functionality -->
## Stacked Cards
Swipeable stacked cards functionality was achieved by using the [flutter_card_swiper](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_card_swiper) package. The package is very verbose and has a lot of customizations such as the number of cards displayed at once, card offsetting, and scaling, it also allows the option to either allow swiping horizontally, vertically or both. Here is the code used in this project with explanatory comments:

**Implementation:**
```dart
/// This widget handles the swipeable stacked cards functionality
CardSwiperr(
  cardsCount: notifier.flashcardsList!.length
)
```
